# Raincheck

Raincheck is a python script that checks tomorrow's forcast, then sends me a Facebook message telling me to bring my bike inside if it's going to rain. I use [ZeevG's forcast-io](https://github.com/ZeevG/python-forecast.io) and  [carpedm20's facebook messenger python](https://github.com/carpedm20/fbchat/) wrappers to complete this project.

To install, you must have both forcast-io and facebook messenger wrappers installed:

```
$ pip install python-forecastio
```

```
$ pip install fbchat
```

finally, run my script:

```
$ python Raincheck.py
```

Enjoy!
